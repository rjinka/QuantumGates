Famous Classical Vs Quantum CHSH game with Alice and Bob players. 
I have added twist by adding John and Mike players to this game. 

Here are rules i came up for playing this game with 4 players.

Classical always gives 0 output as this is the best stategy and This should result in success 75% of the time.

Quantum Alice and Bob get entangled and gives the output.
Simillarly John and Mike get entangled and gives the output.

The referee check if Classcial Alice and Bob output and gives the win or loss. If Alice and Bob loss then the referee check classical John and Mike outout and declare win or loss.

Simillarly Referee check if Quantum Alice and Bob output and gives the win or loss, if Alice and Bob loss then referee check Qunatum John and Mike output and declare win or loss.

I played this 10 Rounds with each round of 20000 times and here is the output.
